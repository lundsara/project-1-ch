## American Art Afficiando Trivia Proposal

This is a trivia game that gives players an image of a work of art and they have to correctly attribute the work to an artist from a four multiple choice options.
The correct answers are tallied against the total and the final results are given at the end of the quiz.
I am making this game because I love American art history and wanted to create a very visual game that I would be interested in playing myself!

## Wireframe

coming soon ...

## Initial thoughts on game structure
landing page with input field for username and a start button that will begin the quiz
series of questions that will produce result of guess after every attempt, the player will have one attempt for each question

## Anticipated Challenges 
* I expect to deal with issues of pagination because I have yet to implement this in javascript!
* Determining when the correct solution has been selected and tallying the results.
* Ending the game when all questions have been asked.
* Creating and randomizing an array of questions and solutions.

## Phases of Completion

I will tackle the very simple HTML to implement my JS.
I will focus on completing my JS file first because that is where I anticipate having the most difficulty and will leave styling to the end because I anticpate that I will have greater ease with this aspect of the game.

If am am able to complete this I would like to add sound effects and a timer!
